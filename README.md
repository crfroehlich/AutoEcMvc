# AutoEcMvc

This is a Code Generation project which uses T4 to automatically generate the Models, Controllers and Views for an ASP.NET Core web app using Entity Framework Core. The original project is based off [Microsoft tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.2) and the source code for the tutorial can be found in the [ASP.NET documentation repo](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/data/ef-mvc/intro/samples/cu-final). I have started blogging about this project on [Medium](https://medium.com/@christopher.r.froehlich/code-generation-connecting-t4-to-entity-framework-core-654e2a0933e8), and you can view the current deployed version of the app on [Azure](https://autoecmvc.luddites.me).
